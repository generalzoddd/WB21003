                Comprising an area of 2,132 sq. kilometres, Wayanad has a powerful history.
                Historians are of the view that organised human life existed in these parts, at least ten centuries before Christ.
                Countless evidences about New Stone Age civilisation can be seen on the hills of Wayanad. 
                The two caves of Ampukuthimala located between Sulthan Bathery and Ambalavayal, with pictures on their walls and pictorial writings, speak volumes of the bygone era and civilisation.
                Recorded history of this district is available from the 18th century.
                In ancient times, this land was ruled by the Rajas of the Veda tribe. 
                In later days, Wayanad came under the rule of the Pazhassi Rajahs of Kottayam royal dynasty. 
                When Hyder Ali becames the ruler of Mysore, he invaded Wayanad and brought it under his sway. 
                In the days of Tipu, Wayanad was restored to the Kottayam royal dynasty. 
                Thus, Wayanad fell into the hands of the British and with it came a new turn in the Home of this area.
                 The British authorities opened up the plateau for cultivation of tea and other cash crops.
                Roads were laid across the dangerous slopes of Wayanad, from Kozhikode and Thalassery. 
                These roads were extended to the cities of Mysore and Ooty through Gudalur.
                Through the roads poured in settlers from all parts of Kerala and the virgin forest lands proved a veritable goldmine with incredible yields of cash crops.
                When the State of Kerala came into being in November 1956, Wayanad was part of Kannur district. Later, south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district. 
                In order to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Wayanad for development, north Wayanad and South Wayanad were carved out and joined together to form the present district of Wayanad.
                This district came into being on November 1, 1980 as the 12 district of Kerala</p>

                Karthigai is possibly the only light festival that is celebrated in Malayali houses.

                Oil lights are lit in houses and the whole town radiates like a bunch of twinkling garlands on the face of dark space, an awesome sight to behold.

                <b>Easter</b><br>
                Is the oldest Christian festival, as old as Christianity itself. 
                The central tenet of Christianity is not the birth of Jesus, but his resurrection.
